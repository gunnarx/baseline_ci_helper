These scripts extract the revision information for dependent layers (poky
and meta-openembedded) from the README of meta-ivi so that automated builds
are possible.

This project shall be cloned into a directory that is in parallel with
meta-ivi in your file system -- i.e. it will try to reference 
../meta-ivi relative to its own directory.
